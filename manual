1.
if products data for a brand have already collected and processed via CJ, don't scrapped and process products data
for the same brand manually to avoid product(s) duplication on site

2. Where a daily upload:
    a. began with data collected and processed via CJ,
    b. consists of manually scrapped data that is being processed immediately after a CJ (or other relevant network's)
       data collection and processing has happened in this current day..

    ensure that 'is_continue_daily_upload_if_any' is set to 'True' for all relevant (or concerned) brands' filter to
    avoid having all p value from being reset and consequently leading to disastrous deletion  of
    (CJ or other relevant Network's data) daily upload progress..

3. Otherwise, if the daily upload began with manually scraped 'and processed' data, ensure that
    'is_continue_daily_upload_if_any' is set to 'is_continue_from_previous_stop_csv'

Also, note: The idea is to have only profitable products for the day on the site. Consequently, yesterday's (uploaded)
product data is obsolete today. Hence, should be cleared..

4. Always ENSURE THAT your ID (PUBLISHER ID and inputted  AD-ID) is correct..
